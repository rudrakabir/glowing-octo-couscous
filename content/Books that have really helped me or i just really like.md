I started reading at a very young age. My parents often used to drop me off at a bookstore(crosswords) when they both had commitments they needed to get to. It had a payphone so I could call them, and plenty of place to sit and chill. I loved it, and read tonnes of books there. I was also addicted to TV at a young age, which caused my parents to remove the TV we had at home, which caused me to read even more. Great ripple effect. It was my number 1 source of entertainment, information, and nourishment. 

1. Freakonomics
2. Outliers for the general consistency is key message(more important than 10000 hours anyway)
3. Famous Five/Secret Seven/Mallory Towers/Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew for adventurer mindset and curiosity
4. fuck i need to start reading again
