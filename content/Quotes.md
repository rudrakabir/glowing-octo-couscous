\-jim wendler

>“Every city has a sex and an age which have nothing to do with demography. Rome is feminine. So is Odessa. London is a teenager, an urchin, and in this hasn’t changed since the time of Dickens. Paris, I believe, is a man in his twenties in love with an older woman.”

\-John Berger


>the more you heal, the more you feel

\-kabir


>“...But if a mirror ever makes  
you sad  
you should know  
that it does

you.”

>“All know that the drop merges into the ocean, but few know that the ocean merges into the drop.”  

\-Kabir(other one)
