So, [[Why making a personal website feels so necessary to me]]

but how?

here is how. 

1. [[it all starts with the name]] register rudrakabir.com
2. build notes.rudrakabir.com so i have some palce to ideate. (oh wow and what a place it is)[[How I made this part of the website, and why]]
3. I wanted 
	- to create this whole thing more or less by myself
	- to not have a recurring cost every month
4. this meant stuff like wix or squarespace was out. 


Now I am at Step 5, learning my way around static site generators, and trying to figure out how I want my site to look. 

I am collecting [[Cool Websites]] as a sort of moodboard, i guess.
