So, [[Why making a personal website feels so necessary to me]]

but how?

here is how. 

1. [[it all starts with the name]] register rudrakabir.com
2. Built notes.rudrakabir.com so i have some place to ideate. (oh wow and what a place it is)([[How I made this part of the website, and why| How]])
3. I wanted 
	- to create this whole thing more or less by myself
	- to not have a recurring cost every month
5. this meant stuff like wix or squarespace was out. 
6. Figured out Jekyll, Minima looks good enough for now. Deployed on GitHub/Netlify.
8. Made some pages, wrote the content.
9. [[Building an embed for trakt live for now]], figured out GitHub actions and secrets



I am collecting [[Cool Websites]] as a sort of moodboard, i guess.
