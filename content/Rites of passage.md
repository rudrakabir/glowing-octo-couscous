I am pretty curious about Rites of passage, and what they mean for people. I have some ideas of some rites of passage that were/could be significant in my own life.

# Ideas
1. getting independent of your family's resources to be able to support yourself
2. completing a grand quest/journey/task
3. undergoing an ordeal of significance
4. psychedelic journeys
5. deep milestones: marriage, death of a parent, courtship
