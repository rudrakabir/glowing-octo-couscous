it all goes here!

I am aiming to review every single thing I watch from now on. I want to be intentional about my media diet, and not just mindlessly binge episode after another. Plus it's great practice, and hopefully will act as a moderator too. 



### Music

I think music takes way more than one listen to truly appreciate the album, so I won't be reviewing every album I listen to, or even try, but I hope to have my favourites here over time.
