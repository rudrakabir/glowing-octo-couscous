Adventurer Mindset. EDC Kit. 

These two ideals are somewhat at odds in my head. One side of me heavily believes in the "Go with the flow" sort of idealogy, with the universe being given free will and agency to sort out my stuff. Which works well a surprising amount of time. 

But it works only because a certain amount of prepeartion has been done. Which pays off whemn it's time to go with the flow. But preparation for the future seems fundamentally at odds with going with the flow
but then where do you get your canoe? if you havent made it? preparing for the flow is part of the flow? Wow I love writing this is why llms aint shit, the finished product is hardly the point of it.

leaving this unedited with typos up for posterity as a simple proof of writing helps you think.
