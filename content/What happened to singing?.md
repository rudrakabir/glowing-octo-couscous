- watching some things just awakens something primal in you
- the crackling of a campfire, looking up at the skies and stars and wondering whats out there, sharing a good meal with friends, its not difficult to imagine that the experience you are having right now is the same experience that our ancestors would have had, many many years ago
- maybe they wouldn't have the same words for it, but its the same experience were having across time

what happened to singing?

- before we had recorded music, songs were purpose built for focus, emotion, camaraderie
- watching any current herder/gatherer/hunter cultures live, their music is sung together, by regular people, doing their thing while singing.
- marching thru the forest singing a marching song, working together sewing singing sewing songs, large numbers of humans congregating together and focusing their energy through singing
		- singing makes sense for the largest amount of people, it being an "instrument that everyone has"
- praying together with hymns(fun fact, did you know that the first forms of the modern musical notation we use today was developed by christian monks to standardise the way they did singing throughout the territory of the church(before telecommunications, by the time infomation got to another side of the planet, there was a high chance it would be distorted by time if it wasnt written down - how do you write music down?)
- singing is a focus maker
