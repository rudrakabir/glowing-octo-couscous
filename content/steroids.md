I have been going to the gym for about 2 years now(off and on, but its the on that counts) and the reason for it is pretty simple, I want to live a long, healthy life, and live it fit and muscular. I am still getting there, and a lot of the content I see talks about steroids, whether it's what happens when you take them or why not to take them, or who's taking them etc etc

For me, I think the choice is pretty obvious, not to take them. 

To get to that place, let me first figure out why someone might want to take them.
