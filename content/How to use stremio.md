I really like stremio. Apart from the fact that it is free, it is also vastly more convenient than streaming services. instead of having to find out where to watch something, if i have a subscription to it, I can simply use stremio to watch all the things, and it automatically trakts things with trakt as well. 

how to use stremio?

1. [Stremio - Freedom to Stream](https://www.stremio.com/) download it from here
2. Once installed, make a profile, let it sync
3. [Torrentio - Stremio Addon](https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure) download the torrent io addon from here, install it in stremio
4. Profit! You can now watch most things
