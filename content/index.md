if you're seeing this already, congratulations, I'd like to know what you think of it. Some stuff ain't final, I want feedback, and I need to fill it up some more and get it fleshed out. 

Hi! I am Rudra Kabir, and this is my shady cozy corner of the internet. It's mainly a way to collect all the various stuff I've scattered in my wake all over the internet so far, and a place to keep my stuff intentionally moving forward. 

I believe the human mind is extremely flexible, and we can do anything we want. This is where I document my experiments with trying to prove that. 

Think of it as a lab, or a workshop, where stuff is still happening, and the outcome is still...undetermined.



Feel free to take a look around!
