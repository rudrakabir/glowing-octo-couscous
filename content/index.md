if you're seeing this already, congratulations, I'd like to know what you think of it. Some stuff ain't final, I want feedback, and I need to fill it up some more and get it fleshed out. 

Hi! I am Rudra Kabir, and this is my shady cozy corner of the internet. It's mainly a way to collect all the various stuff I've scattered in my wake all over the internet so far, and a place to keep my stuff intentionally moving forward. 

I believe the human mind is extremely flexible, and we can do anything we want. This is where I document my experiments with trying to prove that. 

Think of it as a lab, or a workshop, where stuff is still happening, and the outcome is still...undetermined. if you want to learn how to make your own notes page to write and experiment with as you see fit, see [[How I made this part of the website, and why]]


I also want to explore my own identity and have some fun, so some of that is here too. Like [[The Fire Guy]]



Feel free to take a look around, and contact me if you have any questions.
