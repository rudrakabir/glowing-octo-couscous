if you're seeing this already, congratulations, I'd like to know what you think of it. Some stuff ain't final, I want feedback, and I need to fill it up some more and get it fleshed out. 

Hi! I am Rudra Kabir, and this is my shady cozy corner of the internet. It's mainly a way to collect all the various stuff I've scattered in my wake all over the internet so far, and a place to keep my stuff intentionally moving forward. [[FAQ]]

I believe the human mind is extremely flexible, and we can do anything we want. This is where I document my experiments with trying to prove that. 

Think of it as a lab, or a workshop, where stuff is still happening, and the outcome is still...undetermined. if you want to learn how to make your own notes page to write and experiment with as you see fit, see [[How I made this part of the website, and why]]. You may also want to check out [[Guides]] for other Guides.

Some whimsical jumping points would be [[Lists]] or [[Books]] or [[Reviews]] 

[[a collection of linky links]]




I also want to explore my own identity and have some fun, so some of that is here too. Like [[The Fire Guy]]

You might want to use [[Guides]] or [[Links to other places]] or [[Recent Activity]] as jumping off points, I'm still creating more. Right now this space is in the spam seeds and saplings everywhere and see what grows part of the gardening. The pruning and planning and weeding and making beauty comes later. 


Other things I'm up to
- I'm exploring content creation @Kabirontap on Instagram. 
- I host rationality/EA/Slate Star Codex Reading Groups in Ahmedabad


I'm passionate about third spaces, communities, dating discourse, building things, electronics, good audio, big engines, and small kitchen tools. 


Feel free to take a look around, and [[Links to other places|contact me]] if you have any questions.
