I strongly believe that music should be listened to in the form of albums, rather than as songs in a playlist. (when listening to the music)

The song is a trailer, if you will, of the album, and more of an invitation to go on the journey. The thematic cohesiveness of the artist shows much more through the album. It allows the "sleeper" songs to shine, and make sense in the context of an album.

Also, it gives the artist a lot more room to play with you, and bring your emotions up and down. They can bring you down, confident that later they can bring you back up. 

It also serves as a more mindful way of time passing, as the album draws to a close

I don't like algorithmically curated playlists for the same reason. It feels like bland soup, where they choose a theme, and keep you there for eternity. You barely notice the music playing.
