I am currently brushing up on my WebDev skills building my website, and wrote [[Why writing tutorials is so damn difficult]] , when I was browsing through another tutorial ([Fullstack part0 | Fundamentals of Web apps (fullstackopen.com)](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0/fundamentals_of_web_apps)), when I realised a great way to make a list of skills I already have is to see what parts of the tutorial I skip.
