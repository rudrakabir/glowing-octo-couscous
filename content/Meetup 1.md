I was a little apprehensive before this meetup. I had just come back from banaglore and had the idea to have my own meetup. I had spoken to Sachit there who had advised me to start small, and bring a friend at least so that I wouldn't be alone. 

I made posts on the subreddit, registered myself and the meetup on lesswrong, and awaited my first comrades. I chose a cafe in Ahmedabad as the first spot, Ares Cafe. It was an outdoors venue, and had decent seating faraway from each other. 

pretty soon the people showed up, and we started our disucssion,.,
