The calendar is a great example of technical debt
Many years ago we decided this was the calender
now we have to get fucked in various ways


Today, we could design a much better way of dividing time,
but we are so entrenched it for MILLENIA, that we are conclusively stuck for eternity.

Leads to so much inefficiency
