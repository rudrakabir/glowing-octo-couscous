Take zomato for example

Ostensibly, it provides a very simple service: take orders from restaurants, and deliver them to customers. its a delivery service specialising in food. 

the problem comes in when it starts sending you notifications like hey ordering food tonight?
or when they set up teams to figure out why consumers are ordering from outside versus ordering in, and they set up teams in each city to make consumers order more, take in C money to subsidise that shit to eventually drive eating at restaurants out of business altoegther. It's when they intentionally try to change consumer behaviour and drive market forces that the problem starts coming in to play.
