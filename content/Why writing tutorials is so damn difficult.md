As i was writing the [[How I made this part of the website, and why]] bit, I am on this side stream where I am realising that writing tutorials is damn difficult. 

For some stuff, like cooking or knots, it's easier, because you can assume a basic level of context knowledge, and can explain the hard stuff. 

But for this particular one, it was so difficult, because you have to decide whether or not to explain how to initialise a git repo, or whether to go into what obsidian is and does, and what markdown is, and etc etc, don't even get me started on npm

It makes it worse because I started writing it just so that I would rememebr the bits that I find it hard to rememeber, specifically the build commands and the directory that makes the site sync, but instead I thought why not do the whole writeup so that it's just all there in one location.
