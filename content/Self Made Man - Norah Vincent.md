I've been pretty interested in Gender theory and how our society, lived experience, and culture is shaped and shapes our lives due to gender. 

I think my current beliefs on it is somewhat like, even before the reading of this aprtivicar book, 
1. I definitely believe that all human beings regardless of gender deserve equal rights and opportunities
2. I definitely believe that there are some things that society deems innately masculine or feminine and I think for the most part this is silly
3. However I do also believe that there are differences between the sexes and we should treat people accordingly to that. (To use age as an analogy, we talk in baby talk to babies, or talk louder to old people. we still acknowledge both as humans, but recognise that they have different needs when it comes to communication, and act accordingly. I cannot pinpoint the exact difference so easily with gender, but the point is proportionate)
4. I find the current trend of society as trying to see past the differences between all of us, and instead of customising solutions to fit everyone instead of just the Man, are trying to create a template for everyone to fit into instead. 

This book was recommended to me somewhere on reddit, and it is supposed to be about a journalist, who spent an year living as a Man, and how that experience shaped her perception of manhood and masculinity. Interseting. 

I am a straight man, and I love talking about gender, sex, identity and relationships, especially with people who have definitions that conflict with traditional norms.  to this date I feel like the most open and honest conversation I've had about these things were with a gay man and a trans man, both of whom had very interesting things to say about what they consider manly and masculine. I think that conversation is what prompted the google where I reddited this book. 

Now I will actually start reading it, with the intention set in my head.

It all starts with the name. When she starts thinking about how to start this project(of living one year as a man), the first thing she needs, to start mapping out her action plan is a name. She settles on Ned, btw. So similar to my own process. Though I usually get stuck on the name.

It's interesting, the author says she first dressed as an old man, for halloween, when she was seven years old. So odd. It seems true of many artists, that their art seems to be echoes of their childhood. Her Mom was also an actor, who successfully played the part of (a woman playing a man)

It's 1:56 Am on a friday morning and its raining outsside and Im really enjoying reading this book actually. 


“Lacan wrote that love is giving something you don’t possess to someone who doesn’t exist”

“A good point. This came up often in the group—the idea that anger was not an unproductive emotion if followed to its source. The way these guys told it, anger was the one emotion they had in abundance, the one emotion that the world had allowed them to have in abundance, so by implication it contained everything else—sorrow, pain, need, shame. You name it. It was a feeling they knew well, and it was the place where most of their other feelings hid. Nobody here was going to judge you for letting it speak.”
