 A fiendishly good book. 


I was completely entranced by this book from the moment I read it, and I thank my friend Aditya P. for giving it to me.

The basic thrust of this book is so bizarre that summing it up like this almost seems insane, but the point of the author is that certain human beings that have affinities towards the local flora and fauna, and know them very well, are in fact using psychedelic insight gained from taking an ayahuasca like drug to literally talk to the plants at a DNA level to ascertain their chemical or biologial uses. This is an absolutely mind-blowing proposition, and the point he seems to make indeed seems to be the point he is making.
