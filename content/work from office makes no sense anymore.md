The modern office is a vestigial organ. It makes no sense anymore. 

As i can see it, this is how place of work eveolves

Hunter gatherer times, there is no centralised office. You go where your resources are, you work where you have the tools and reoursces. Work and life aren't distinct, as work is just tied into life. 

Agricultural societiyes, there start being "locations" where work is. If you farm, you need to go to the farm. Still, the work was done within your house, or farm, blacksmith's workshop, which was often close to where you already were. 

Industrial periods is where the aberration starts. Can't have a factory without a factory, so the workers need to go to the factory. The office starts to emerge, because someone needs to manage the factory.  Money and rent further complicate the issue, because previously you'd build near your home, but now you can decide how much farther you want to live away to save oney. 

Corparate Period(today) as businesses become bigger, more complex, centralised offices start making sense, decoupled from factory. Computers are expensive and large, meaning it makes sense to have them in a specifric location and people move there. 

But now. now computers are tiny, and work is not physical. It makes zero sense to have digital tools and still commute to an office anyway.
