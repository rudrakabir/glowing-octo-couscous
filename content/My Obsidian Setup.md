Often when talking about writing, a recommended tip is to have a specific audience in mind. For some of this, the audience I have is like a Memento version of me that doesn't remember anything, so to bring him up to speed on latest me, here is the guide.

Obsidian is like my digital home now. If it's not on Obisidian, it doesn't exist. This is because I am now coming up on 2 decades of using computers. It's not possible to remember all the apps, files, different ways of organising infromation, where information is stored in my head anymore. I have to get it down to paper or it will just vanish into the ether.
