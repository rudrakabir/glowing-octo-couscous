Remember that pianist who said that if he
did not practice every day he would know, if he did not practice
for two days, the critics would know, after three days, his audi-
ences would know.
A variation of this is true for writers. Not that your style,
whatever that is, would melt out of shape in those few days.
But what would happen is that the world would catch up with
and try to sicken you. If you did not write every day, the poisons
would accumulate and you would begin to die, or act crazy, or
both.
You must stay drunk on writing so reality cannot destroy you.

Damn
