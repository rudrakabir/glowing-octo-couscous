I have no problem with the actual technical aspect of writing, as in putting my thoughts into words. It's always been frictionless to me. I write how I speak, and if I have something to say, I can write it down easily. The problem is more what to say.

Because all the writing I have read feels so impactful, I feel like I should be writing about my values or these big overarching thoughts I have sporadically, but somehow that thing eludes me, so this is the best I can do. 

I have been reading about complex systems recently, and this is something that stands out to me

>“A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work.”  
― John Gall, [The Systems Bible: The Beginner's Guide to Systems Large and Small](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/570642)


This is a concept that immediately appeals to me. I have been for a long time a person prone to grand plans in my head, but given to realise that it is impossible to go from zero to Grand Plan immediately, and so am so fazed I find it impossible to start.

I have been watching 30 rock recently. It's a really great show, particularly the relationship between Liz Lemon and Jack Donaghy. It's a mentor/mentee kinda thing but the learning does go both ways, and it really is such a wholesome relationship. I hope to be on both sides of that someday.


30 Rock for me is about that problem, more or less. Liz Lemon is someone who thinks of herself as this cultured, intellectual artsy type, but her chosen form of expression is a show that is essentially fart jokes. Fascinating duality. 

I want a lot of things in my life too. But the gap between where I am and where I want to go feels so large, that it almost feels insurmountable. But here is to taking that one small step. That simple system that works, works well enough to iterate, to evolve.
