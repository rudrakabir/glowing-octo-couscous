i have no problem with the actual technical aspect of writing, as in putting my thoughts into words. The problem is more what to say. Because all the writing I have read feels so impactful, I feel like I should be writing about my values or these big overarching thoughts I have sporadically, but somehow that thing eludes me, so this is the best I can do.

I have been watching 30 rock recently. It's a really great show, particularly the relationship between LizLemon and Jack Donaghy. It's a mentor/mentee kinda thing but the learning does go both ways, and it really is such a wholesome relationship. I hope to be on both sides of that someday. 


30 rock for me is about that problem, more or less. Liz Lemon is someone who thinks of herself as this cultured, intellectual artsy types, but her chosen form of expression is a show that is essentially fart jokes.
