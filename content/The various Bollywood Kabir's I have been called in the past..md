As someone named Kabir, I can measure my life through the different Kabir's that bollywood has granted me. 


When Chak de india released, Kabir Khan


When Kabir Singh released =, everyone called me....you guessed it, Kabir Singh



When ZNMD released, Kabir Diwan

When YJHD released, everyone called me...bunny

People used to make the "dhoom" motion at me and call me Kabir too. 

All of this was in good fun and jest, but I minded some of it. I didn't like the Kabir Singh character, and it made me uncomfortable the idea of people imbibing any of that character's energy into how they perceived me. 
And even though they meant it in jest, and it wasn't that serious, I chafed at the thought that people would project their thoughts and feelings about the character onto me.

The rest of it is all in good fun though, and it's secretly kinda enjoyable. Some people have positive connotations for some of these characters too, and somehow they sorta transfer over? IDK. Fun stuff to think about though. It's like temporarily microdosing in a very mild and pleasant way the feeling you might get being "profiled" for your name in a place that does that.
