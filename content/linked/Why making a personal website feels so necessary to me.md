I registered this domain about an year back, but am only now starting to really make sense of what it's supposed to be. 

I have been on the internet for what feels like a long time now. In the heydays of IRC, and adium, and multiple amazing internet forums dedicated to arcana of all kinds, I learnt what amazing communities can do together(shoutout fountainpennetwork). But in this age of enshittification, i feel demoralised by the thought that the stuff I put so much feeling into writing is completely out of my control. 

After the downfall of Apollo, the best reddit app there ever was(Apart from Alien Blue, the best reddit app there ever was - ([[Why reddit is (was?)my favourite social media - but isn't anymore]])), I started spending a lot of time on my phone on twitter instead, which led me to discover this guy @visakanv, who is a really great writer, and that's something that i always aspired to be. 


But what to/where to/how to has given me severe analysis paralysis, so while I figure that out on the side, I want to at least start the most difficult part of the process, actually writing. so the basic point is that everyone has good writing in them, they just have to get the bad writing(actually, extends to more than just writing), out of the way first. and that kinda makes sense? 

So I am writing these live, in my obsidian, without any editing, constant stream of thought kinda stuff. The aim is consistency first, and quality will come. And this is where that stuff lives. 

I have been a big follower of the building in public movement, because the high production qualoity of today's online output fazes me, and I feel damn inspired by people who have the courage to post works in progress in public.
