This is for me to remember what stuff I need to do next on this notes section

## notes.rudrakabir.com
- figure out some explorer for mobile
- figure out how to get some sort of recently created and recently updated files going 
- make some good jumping off points
- start weeding
	- tagging things\
	- joining things
	- removing things possibly

## main site
- i want some cooler colors, make it a look a bit more snazzy

## subdomain
i want a subdomain to host some funky shit that doesn't interact with the other two domains code wise. maybe ship.rudrakabir.com?
