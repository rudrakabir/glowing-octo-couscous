Who We Are  

The Arkus team is led by Dr. Anupama Ramkumar. Trained as a physician and researcher, she has been associated with the Clinical Research industry in India, since the time the first CROs started being set up and the trials begun. She has trained teams and setup operations for two Clinical research units for one of the first wholly Indian CRO, Lambda Therapeutic Research. She has supported more than 500 BE studies and herself been the Principal Investigator for some of the first Early phase studies done in India. She has been through several successful regulatory inspections which include the USFDA, AFSSAPS, WHO and Anvisa.  

In the last three years she has supported and advised several sponsors keen on running their phase I-IV studies in India in correct positioning and identifying an India based strategy, in vendor selection and qualification processes, audits and monitoring.
