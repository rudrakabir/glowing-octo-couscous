Bodybuilder, Actor, producer, governor

 I remember someone saying to me, or maybe I read it, I can't remember, that a man must have at least one project, skill talent, anything, outside of work, to which he has devoted at least 10 years of his life to. That proves that he is capable of the long term, consistent effort required to pull off great things. Arnold Schwarzenegger has undoubtedly pulled off great things, and I want to as well. 

  In my opinion, making that project your body is a great idea. Here is why. 
  
1. Undeniable Proof. A fit person looks fit. They carry the proof of that hard work around with them all the time. You don't have to open your mouth. No one else has to open theirs either. Without an introduction of your achievements, link to TedX talk, CV, even clothes, none of it matters. A fit person proves they have the dedication required to visualise an outcome, plan for it, and execute the plan to make it happen. 
2. Health! A lot of things can fulfil the skill criteria. For example, putting 10 years into playing the guitar is surely a cool thing. You'll end up pretty good at the guitar, which is pretty impressive, fun, cool, and attractive! But you'll still need to be healthy to enjoy all that. Kill two birds with one stone.
