1. software
	1. OBS is dope
	2. twitch allows you to start instantly, youtube is still making me wait 24 hours to start streaming
	3. i wanted to stream factorio
2. hardware
	1. desktop playing game
	2. macbook controlling stream
	3. pibox video capture card

initially i tried plugging the capture card into the laptop, hdmi out from pc into capture card, hdmi out from mac into monitor, and use the monitor as a "projector" preview in OBS, but quickly found out that that would not work, because there was some lag between the mouse moving, which made the game unplayable

first i thought I needed a capture card with HDMI passthrough, which I didn't know existed(was about 300 rupees more, so i almost bought it and returned the one I had), but then remembered that i could simply mirror monitors and my GPu and monitor both have displayport, so i am using the capture card as one monitor, the monitor as 2nd monitor, and simply mirroring the two

this makes my setup perfect

for audio, using the monitoring fucntion of OBS slurs my speech a lot, and speaking like that was surprisingly hard. and the noise suppression feature works GREAT to cut down fan noise. I simply turned off monitoring once i was happy with my volume. 

Setting up with twitch was easy, and i was off playing factorio. It took me about 45 minutes to figure out the whole process, and by the time i was done i had something else to get to, but this was a great start, imo. 

starting to stream was not that hard. 
a succesful day 1.
