my friend recently let me borrow his projector in an insanely generous way. It's a fairly cool piece of equipment, and I saw a reel that was doing some projection mappong, so i want to try it out

the internet still astounds me 
i saw the reel, got on my laptop, the comments had the name of the software, touchdesigner, and I had it in 15 minutes. Now to try it out.
