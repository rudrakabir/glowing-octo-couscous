> “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” - Frank Herbert

Fuck I'm so scared. I was just watching [this video, and at 3:33, ](https://youtu.be/9UgAteHZE9I?t=212) he says something incredible. He says "our standards and our quality is like the highest in the industry". And as he says it you can see he knows it. He believes it. Making something is difficult. Making something and being sure it's good it's harder still. Making something and having the confidence to know it's the best goddamn thing in it's category on the planet is a different league entirely. 

I am a maker at heart. A builder. A craftsman. But until you make those things, you haven't made them. You don't know.
