A few weeks back, I saw a 30 day song challenge on Instagram. For 30 days, you had to, everyday, post a song based on a prompt within the challenge. 

This seems easy, all you had to do was read the prompt, choose an appropriate song, and post it on your story. Yet for me, this posed a unique challenge - consistency was my weak point.  

damn, creation is hard yo
leave alone making good stuff, 
just sticking to a pre-made template and doing that consistently is damn hard
low resolution becomes high resolution makes itself apparent again. All things have detail and craft and art when you look at them close enough.

So what do I learn from this?
Let's start the next thing.
