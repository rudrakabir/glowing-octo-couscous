One of my mostest favouritest books in the world is Surely you're joking, Mr Feynman. It's Richard Feynman's autobiographical account of his explots in life. I looooooooove that book. I carry a microscope everyday in my bag in honour of that book. It has inspired me to do so many great things. I think feynman was one of those great geniuses.
