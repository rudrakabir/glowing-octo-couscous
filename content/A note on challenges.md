I have been ruminating on the idea of challenges for a while. 

One of my moms oft repeated mantras is the importance of consistency, consistency is key, just show up. Something she attributes her success in life to, and it certainly is testament to that. 

It is also one of my achilles heel(i have many, perhaps on one of my other left feet), since i crave novelty and adrenaline, and the minute any interest goes from the learning(new stuff ) to the doing(same stuff again but a tiny bit better x 100 till mastery), is when i quickly move on to the next obsession. It has contributed greatly to breadth, but depth is something i haven't cultivated.

two great influences on me, have been the ideas of visakan and struthless, who both espouse the idea of "get the shitty stuff out of the way" and "choose a thing"(amongst other people, but the way they put it appeals to me). In that vein, a challenge is a great way to do that. see if you can do the same thing as a goal. the novelty of that meta goal, as it turns out is a great motivator(i think this was paraphrasing @mykola but i could be wrong) 

the final note in this i think has recently been ankit baiyanpuria and 75 hard challenge. the man just did the same thing everyday, and he was an absolute god for it. 

a challenge seems like a great, structured way to build depth in something, as well as to prove something to myself that I think it's important to prove.
