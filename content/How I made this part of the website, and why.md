This is the "notes" section of my website. 

I want to take a bit to my document the process of creating this section of the website, both in the interests of reducing friction for me personally in terms of remembering to keep it updated, and to help you make a notes section for your website, if you want to.

This section is inspired by the working-in-public philosophy, that celebrates the existence of "unfinished", or work in progress projects, as something not to be hidden away until it's time for the grand reveal, but a continuous act over time. Much like gardening. I wanted to have a place where I can put down drafts of thoughts while they take shape in my brain, of any size and shape. I also wanted freedom from the constraints of the posting methods of social platforms and the dark patterns they employ, so I hosted this on my own website(also a work still in progress). I hope this is a safe nourishing environment where my ideas will mature before they are ready to go out into the world on their own.

The beauty of it is that it integrates with my favourite program in the world, Obsidian, where I already do most of my writing, so posting and editing content is damn damn easy. Apart from the domain registration charges(which are optional, if you don't want your own domain), it is also hosted online completely free.

On to the tutorial!
(A lot of the information here is taken from various sources online, I am collating it here for my easy reference)

Step 1. Get a Website. I used Namecheap to register the domain itself, and am currently learning how to use Astro + Netlify to build and host the site. rudrakabir.com

Step 2. Get quartz on a subdomain in the website and get it synced up with github, and your obsidian vault. 

Step 3. Everytime you make changes in Obsdian, all i need to do is navigate to the directory that my quartz lives in,
