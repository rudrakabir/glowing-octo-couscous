I want to live take certain thoughts or comments when I read books, this is where I will do that. Some of them might not have much, but at least it will serve as a list of books I attempted to read, a sort of taste metadata.

[[The Cosmic Serpent - Jeremy Narby]]
[[Self Made Man - Norah Vincent]]
[[Zen in the Art of Writing - Ray Bradbury]]
[[The man from the Future - Ananya Bhattacharya]]
