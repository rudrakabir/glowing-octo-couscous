I am in the beginnings of my exploration into this scene, so let's get into it. 

Ahmedabad is sort of an anomaly in the evening/nightlife scene of things. Due to being a dry state, there are no bars to hang out in. This makes coffee shops an alternative place for these youngsters to hang out afterhours, smoking tonnes of cigarettes.

There are entire roads that have series of cafes, one after the other, catering to every price point and style of coffee. Expensive cars and glitzily dressed up people sit and talk for hours(of course, smoking like chimneys.). As a non smoker, or someone who notices smoking, it feels like a different world altogether.
