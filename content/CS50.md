I have been programming since a pretty long time, school even. But most of it has been for a single task, and discarded pretty soon after.

It's a powerful thing though, so a good foundation and steady progress helps. Especially today, as AI makes the whole process so much easier since the biggest problem for me was always remembering the syntax, the logic itself is crystal clear form the beginning.

I have tried CS50 a few times before, and sometimes life gets in the way. Maybe this is the one. I tried the 2023 version, and stopped after week 4. Now I'm doing the 2024 version.

## Why am I doing this?
I work with code a lot. It makes sense to have a foundational understanding of it instead of the piecemeal approach I've taken so far.

I'm gonna speedrun cs50
# Week 0 - Scratch
2024-09-24 05:28 I completed it. I did it according to the letter of the law, not the spirit because I have a good idea of these fundamentals and don't wanna spend a lot of time with a GUI. 

# Week 1 - C
**24-09-2024, Tue** 05:35
Week 1 has three assignments
Hello world, Mario, Cash

**24-09-2024, Tue** 05:41 I've completed the hello assignment but the codespace is taking longer to load than it took me to write hello world. I love VSCode local so much.


**24-09-2024, Tue** 06:04 Done hello, world, done hello, me.
